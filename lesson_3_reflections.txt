When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In the case that I want other people to see my repository, comment on it, give feedback, work on it...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If anybody else made some changes to the remote repository I might want to check the changes before pulling them to my local repository.
