What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I initialize a repository by the command git init. I have to be in the directory of the folder that I want to become a repository. Then a repository is initialized in that directory. There are no commits yet and no files included in the repository (even if there are files in the directory). I can check the status of the repository by running the command git status.
I need to do this in order to make a directory a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
At the moment I am not quite sure about that since I haven't completly understood the function of the staging area. But I think it is valuebale in the sense that I can make different commits of the same repository that have different logical values. Furthermore it is the intermediate area between the working directory and the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use the command git diff. This command compares the working directory to the staging area. But I am absolutly not sure if this answers the question.
